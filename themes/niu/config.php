<p>If you are using this version of VuFind for the <strong>first time</strong>, you are required to set 
up your account profile by entering library, barcode and last name. This information can be retrieved 
from your valid NIU OneCard. If your profile was not linked to your library account successfully, 
you will be prompted to finish the set-up of your library catalog profile every time you click on one 
of the categories listed in "Your Account". You will be able to request items from the catalog as 
soon as this step has been completed successfully.</p>
<p>Please note saved items (lists and favorites) will <strong>not</strong> be migrated from 
previous versions of VuFind.</p>
